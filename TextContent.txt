Moring uncle. Tell me what you think of this 

Rough draft. 

We at Andrew Marshal's Consultancy strive to deliver the most effective and efficient services in South Africa. We exert ourselves so as to give our clients our best and offer quality performance provided with integrity. 


Our mission is to assist businesses and entrepreneurs alike, by providing: 

• Marketing of your business - through events and/or branding - for example, T-shirt printing. 
• Sourcing and referrals - finding you the appropriate and qualified staff and/or business partners, as well as the best suppliers of goods and services your business may need.
•Restoration - by providing consultations with management to improve the organization's performance and efficiency
• Logistics - for any goods and materials your business needs transported, distributed or stored. 
•** Legal aid - we have an attorney in our offices for any legal assistance or advice needed**

We aim to provide quality service and full transparency – we will not withhold any information concerning our clients from them. ** Any legal advice needed or any other contracts entered into by our clients may be explained to them if needed.**


** everything in these Astrix means that I wrote it in pencil and you can choose whether or not to include it or to ask your uncle if the inclusion on that information would be false**
